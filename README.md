# Movie Recommendation Chatbot

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides movie recommendations based on user queries. It uses advanced language models and vector-based search to retrieve and rank movie suggestions. The system integrates multiple AI-powered APIs and models to ensure an engaging and accurate chatbot experience.
