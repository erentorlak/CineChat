# Movie Recommendation Chatbot

This project is a Flask-based web application that provides movie recommendations based on user queries. It uses advanced language models and vector-based search to retrieve and rank movie suggestions. The system integrates multiple AI-powered APIs and models to ensure an engaging and accurate chatbot experience.

---

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations:** Suggests movies based on user input and retrieves relevant titles with detailed metadata.
- **Flask-based Web Interface:** Simple and user-friendly web interface for interaction.
- **AI-Powered Search:** Uses OpenAI embeddings and self-query retrievers to find the most relevant movies.
- **Customizable Backend:** Supports Groq and OpenAI models for dynamic query handling.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8 or later**: Ensure you have Python installed.
2. **API Keys**: Set up API keys for OpenAI and Groq.
3. **Environment**: `pip` and `virtualenv` or any Python environment manager.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/movie-recommendation-chatbot.git
   cd movie-recommendation-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     PORT=5000  # Optional, default is 5000
     ```

5. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Place the `CineChatCSV_cleaned_new.csv` file in the root directory.

## Notes

- Ensure the `movie_vectorstore5openai` directory exists or will be created during runtime for vector storage.
- Use the latest versions of dependencies to avoid compatibility issues.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing API Keys**: Verify the `.env` file contains valid API keys.
- **Dependency Issues**: Run `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` to update dependencies.
- **Port Conflicts**: Modify the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file to use a different port.
